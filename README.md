## Overview

**Zuri Market** is a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace built for Kenyan women to
discover fashion, beauty, wellness, and lifestyle products from verified sellers. It's
engineered as a modular monolith designed to scale to 1M+ users, 100K+ sellers, and
20M+ product listings without a rewrite — see [`docs/Architecture.md`](docs/Architecture.md)
for the full system design rationale.

The platform serves three audiences from one codebase:

- **Buyers** — browse, search, and purchase from a storefront organized around Fashion,
  Beauty, Wellness, and Lifestyle categories.
- **Sellers** — onboard (with KYC verification), list products, manage inventory, and
  fulfill orders from a dedicated seller dashboard.
- **Admins** — moderate listings, resolve disputes, and manage platform configuration
  from an internal admin console.

## Preview

Product UI screenshots will be added to `docs/screenshots/` as storefront, seller, and
admin surfaces stabilize toward release.

## Features

- 🛍️ **Multi-vendor storefront** — category browsing, search, product discovery, and
  collections across Fashion, Beauty, Wellness, and Lifestyle
- 🧾 **Seller platform** — guided onboarding, Didit-powered KYC verification, product and
  inventory management, order fulfillment
- 🛒 **Cart & checkout** — full cart, checkout, and order lifecycle with payment
  orchestration
- 💬 **Buyer–seller messaging** — real-time conversations tied to orders and listings
- ⭐ **Reviews & trust** — product/seller reviews, ratings, and trust signals
- 🔐 **Role-based access** — `buyer`, `seller`, `admin`, and `moderator` roles enforced via
  Postgres Row Level Security *and* mirrored route guards
- 📊 **Admin & analytics** — moderation tools, seller analytics, business intelligence,
  and platform-wide observability
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app and transactional notifications across key events
- 📱 **PWA-ready** — installable, offline-aware app shell (`app/manifest.ts`, `app/offline`)
- ♿ **Accessible by default** — skip navigation, reduced-motion support, semantic
  component primitives

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), and a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/learninghub44/KENYA-E-COMMERCE-LADIES.git
cd KENYA-E-COMMERCE-LADIES
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your Supabase/Cloudinary/Didit/GA values
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm dev            # start the Next.js dev server
pnpm lint           # ESLint + TypeScript project check
pnpm typecheck       # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test            # domain unit tests (lib/**, middleware/**)
pnpm test:unit        # Vitest unit test suite
pnpm test:watch        # Vitest in watch mode
pnpm build              # production build
pnpm start                # run the production build locally
```

Before opening a pull request, run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build`
— see [`docs/Contributing.md`](docs/Contributing.md) for the full workflow and
[`docs/ReviewChecklist.md`](docs/ReviewChecklist.md) / [`docs/DefinitionOfDone.md`](docs/DefinitionOfDone.md)
before requesting review.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide the following:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous/public key (client-side, RLS-scoped) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key — **server-only**, never expose to the client |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name for the media pipeline |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret |
| `DIDIT_API_KEY` | Didit KYC API key (seller verification) |
| `DIDIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret used to verify Didit webhook signatures |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Google Analytics measurement ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Canonical app URL, used for metadata and absolute links |

Never commit real values for these — `.env.local` is git-ignored. Rotate any credential
immediately if it's ever exposed in a commit, PR, or chat log.

## Deployment

The application is designed to run behind **Cloudflare** (CDN, WAF, DDoS protection) in
front of the Next.js app, with **Supabase** as the sole data and auth layer:

```
Internet Users → Cloudflare (CDN / WAF) → Next.js Application → Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Auth + Edge Functions)
                                                                → Cloudinary (media)
                                                                → Didit (seller KYC)
```

1. Provision a Supabase project and run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in order
   (or via `scripts/run-supabase-sql.js`).
2. Set all variables from [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) in your hosting
   provider's environment configuration.
3. Build with `pnpm build` and deploy the standard Next.js production output.
4. Point Cloudflare DNS at your hosting provider and enable the WAF/rate-limiting rules
   described in [`docs/Security.md`](docs/Security.md).

See [`docs/Scalability.md`](docs/Scalability.md) for caching, pagination, and read/write
separation guidance as traffic grows.

## Security

- **Identity:** Supabase Auth is the sole identity provider — no custom password storage.
- **Authorization:** Row Level Security is enabled and forced on every table containing
  user-owned or sensitive data; roles (`buyer`, `seller`, `admin`, `moderator`, `service`)
  are enforced in RLS policies and mirrored in route guards.
- **Data protection:** PII and KYC documents are never logged; payment credentials are
  never stored on our infrastructure.
- **Input handling:** All external input is validated against a schema before use; webhook
  endpoints verify provider signatures.
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare WAF and rate limiting sit in front of all public
  endpoints; dependency vulnerabilities are scanned in CI.

Full details: [`docs/Security.md`](docs/Security.md). To report a security issue, see
[Contact](#contact) — please do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities.

## Performance

- Stateless application layer — any instance can serve any request.
- Aggressive edge caching for catalog/listing pages via Cloudflare (ISR / cache tags).
- Cursor-based pagination on every list endpoint, with indexes added in the same
  migration as the column they cover.
- A single data-access layer per module, so routing reads to a replica later is a config
  change, not a rewrite.
- High-growth tables (`orders`, `messages`, `product_events`) are candidates for
  time/seller-range partitioning once they justify it.

## FAQ

**Is this a monorepo?**
The codebase currently lives at the repository root as a single Next.js application.
`docs/FolderStructure.md` describes the target `apps/web` layout as the project grows
toward a workspace structure.

**Why Supabase instead of a self-managed database + ORM?**
Supabase gives us Postgres, Row Level Security, Auth, and Edge Functions as one
integrated layer, which keeps authorization enforced at the database level rather than
solely in application code. See [`docs/Architecture.md`](docs/Architecture.md) for the
full rationale.

**Can I use npm or yarn instead of pnpm?**
The repository is configured as a pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
`pnpm-lock.yaml`). Use pnpm to guarantee consistent installs.

**How do I get seller KYC working locally?**
You'll need a Didit sandbox API key and webhook secret in `.env.local`. See
[`docs/kyc/`](docs/kyc/) for the integration details.

**Where do I raise questions about architecture or cross-module interfaces?**
Open a GitHub issue tagged `interface-request` for cross-module needs, or an ADR
proposal in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) for architectural questions — see
[`docs/Contributing.md`](docs/Contributing.md).
